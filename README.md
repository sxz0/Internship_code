# Internship_code
Code developed during the internship at armasuisse S&amp;T at Thun

The devices where organized in a local network with the following IPs:
- Rasp 4: *192.168.0.4-14* 
- Rasp 3: *192.168.0.15-25*
- Rasp 1: *192.168.0.26-35*

*command_RPiXXXX.sh* scripts help to send commands to all the devices of the same model/same GPU

*launch_data_collection.sh* and *gather_data.sh* are used to start the data collection campains and retrieve the data afterwards.
